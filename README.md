# Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into one of three species based on their features: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The classification is performed using a trained machine learning model and a user-friendly web interface created with Streamlit.

## Features

- Interactive web-based interface for iris classification.
- Model trained on the classic Iris dataset.
- Simple and intuitive design for inputting features and viewing results.

## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J2A9-11/IRIS-Flower-Prediction.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, use the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

Start the Streamlit app by running:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 4. Access the Application

Once the app is running, open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Access Online

You can also access the deployed application online at the following URL:

[https://ml-lab.streamlit.app/](https://ml-lab.streamlit.app/)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for building and training the model.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for deploying machine learning models as web applications.

## Dataset

The project uses the Iris dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle and widely used for classification tasks.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more feature visualizations for better understanding.
- Deploy the app on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
